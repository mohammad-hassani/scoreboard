# scoreboard
is a html file using js and sass to make a score board project
you can run this by runing the html file
first set the numbers of youre teams (must be in pwoer of 2, like 2,4,8,16,32,...  i'll maybe complete it with all numbers ;))
then set youre teams name and it shows you the weekly boards and a board that show details of teams 
you can set the team goals and save it and you see the team board changes
good luck...
